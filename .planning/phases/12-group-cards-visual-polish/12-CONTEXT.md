# Phase 12: Group Cards & Visual Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Transform the home screen into a polished, branded product. Group cards show last activity date, member avatar stack, and per-group balance at a glance. Dashboard gets accent/brand touches and warm visual personality. Empty states feel friendly and guide users toward action.

## Implementation Decisions

### Balance header treatment
- Gradient background behind the balance area at the top of the dashboard
- Dark-to-accent fade style — bold, app-like feel
- Should integrate with existing green/red balance color-coding

### Card style
- Glassmorphism for group cards — semi-transparent with blur effect
- Premium, modern feel that works with the dark theme
- Each group card should feel distinct from the background

### Color palette
- Warm accent tones (amber, coral) alongside existing green/red balance colors
- Friendly, warm vibe — Filipino fiesta energy
- Warm accents used for brand touches, not replacing the functional green/red system

### Empty states
- Minimal + English — simple icon with short English copy
- Clean, professional tone — not overly playful
- Should guide users toward action (create group, add expense)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact gradient colors and direction for balance header
- Specific glassmorphism blur intensity and transparency levels
- Which warm accent colors to use (specific amber/coral hex values)
- Group card information layout (avatar stack positioning, balance placement, last activity format)
- Micro-interactions and press effects on cards
- Typography adjustments for polish pass

## Specific Ideas

- Gradient background for balance area — bold, app-like
- Glassmorphism cards — premium feel on dark theme
- Warm accents (amber, coral) for brand personality beyond just balance colors
- Empty states should be minimal and professional, not cutesy
