# Requirements: HatianApp v1.1 — Invites & Settle Up

**Defined:** 2026-02-19
**Core Value:** A group of friends can add shared expenses and instantly see who owes who, with simplified balances that minimize the number of transactions needed.

## v1.1 Requirements

### Invite System

- [x] **INV-01**: Phone lookup correctly identifies existing users regardless of phone format (fix +/no-+ mismatch)
- [x] **INV-02**: Only the group creator can add members by phone number
- [x] **INV-03**: When a user is added by phone, they receive an invite (not auto-added to the group)
- [x] **INV-04**: User can see pending group invites on the home screen (invite inbox)
- [x] **INV-05**: User can accept a group invite and be added as a full member
- [x] **INV-06**: User can decline a group invite
- [x] **INV-07**: Declining an invite removes all associated expense splits for that pending member
- [x] **INV-08**: Invite link flow (share sheet -> deep link) continues to auto-join without accept/decline

### Settle Up

- [x] **SETL-01**: User can mark the whole net balance as settled between themselves and another group member
- [x] **SETL-02**: Settlement is recorded with amount, payer, payee, and timestamp
- [x] **SETL-03**: User can view settlement history in a group (who paid who, when)
- [x] **SETL-04**: Settled amounts reduce the displayed balance between two people in balance views
